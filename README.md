# S9 FiveM Phone

It's just a re-designed phone based on ALphone from esx_public. In order to use it, you have to download it from: https://github.com/ESX-PUBLIC/esx_ALphone-Blackberry-system < and follow the instructions how to setup the original one and then replace the existing phone3 files with my files. Easy as that :)
